# BLExplorer - A Bluetooth LE explorer

This is a UWA that enables you to connect to a Bluetooth LE device and list the services, characteristics, and descriptors it offers.

Future features:
* Choose the type of a given characteristic, in order to display it properly. (E.g. if the characteristic is a float, show it as a float, rather than a hex representation of the value.)
* Changing characteristic values.

According to the [MAKE:Bluetooth book](http://www.makershed.com/products/make-bluetooth) that I'm reading, there are already tools like this for other operating systems. I want one I can use on my Windows Phone.
